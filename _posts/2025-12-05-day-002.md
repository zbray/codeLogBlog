5 December 2025, 8:30-9:00 and 9:50-10:30

Tonight I fired up a jekyll site on GitHub to start tracking my progress. I made a post with the log of what I reviewed and took notes on yesterday. This site will just be for my mentor at work and not public-facing. That took about 30 minutes and then I went a step further and bought a domain. This will be my public facing site that will be half programming and half "me." TBD on the details of how I'll build this out but more to come.
