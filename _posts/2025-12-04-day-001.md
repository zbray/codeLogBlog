Today I warmed up with HTML and CSS and then moved on to The Odin Project's JavaScript lesson on Variables and Operators where I followed along and took some notes

## Sandbox warm-up

- Made a button in JavaScript that changes text on the page when you click a button

```html
<body>
  <button id="myButton">Click Me!</button>
  <p id="output">Waiting for a click...</p>
  <script>
    const button = document.getElementById("myButton");
    const output = document.getElementById("output");
    function handleClick() {
      output.textContent = "Button was clicked!";
    }
    button.addEventListener("click", handleClick);
```

This inline script creates a button variable `button` from the element with the id `myButton` and an `output` from the element with the id `output`. The function `handleClick` will replace the text content in the `output` variable with "Button was clicked" I added an `addEventListener` to the `button` variable that will run the function `handleClick` when `button` is clicked

Made a calculator in HTML/CSS that resembles the current iOS 25 calculator (black background, round buttons, different color buttons for different functions) No functionality at the moment, will add JavaScript functionality over time.

```html
<div>
  <input type="text" value="12345" readonly style="width: 128px; text-align: right"/>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><button type="button" class="topLeft">⌫</button></td>
      <td><button type="button" class="topLeft">AC</button></td>
      <td><button type="button" class="topLeft">%</button></td>
      <td><button type="button" class="func">÷</button></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><button type="button" class="num">7</button></td>
      <td><button type="button" class="num">8</button></td>
      <td><button type="button" class="num">9</button></td>
      <td><button type="button" class="func">x</button></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><button type="button" class="num">4</button></td>
      <td><button type="button" class="num">5</button></td>
      <td><button type="button" class="num">6</button></td>
      <td><button type="button" class="func">-</button></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><button type="button" class="num">1</button></td>
      <td><button type="button" class="num">2</button></td>
      <td><button type="button" class="num">3</button></td>
      <td><button type="button" class="func">+</button></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><button type="button" class="num">+/-</button></td>
      <td><button type="button" class="num">0</button></td>
      <td><button type="button" class="num">.</button></td>
      <td><button type="button" class="func">=</button></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
```

```css
body {
  background-color: black; 
} 
button { 
  border-radius: 50%; 
  width:30px;   
  color: white; 
  } 
.func { 
  background-color: orange; 
  } 
.topLeft {
  background-color: #888888; 
} 
.num { 
  background-color: #484848; 
  } 
```

## JavaScript - Variables and Operators (Odin Project)

### Lesson Overview

- Run JS in HTML
- `let` and `const`
- number operations
- string operations
- logic and math operators

### Variables

The building blocks of any program, "storage containers" for data in your code.

You can declare variables using the `let` keyword.

```js
let firstName = "John";
let lastName = "Doe";

console.log (firstName)
console.log (lastName)
```

You can also re-assign variables:

```js
let age = 20;
console.log(age) // outputs 20
age = 52;
console.log(age) // outputs 54
```

The re-assigning on line 3 does not require the `let` variable since it's already been declared on line 1.

You'd use the `const` keyword for a variable you don't want to change

```js
const pi = 3.14;
pi = 10;

console.log(pi); // throws an error since you cannot re-assign const variables
```

`var` is a mostly deprecated way that variables were declared before the language introduced `let` and `const`

Not used much at all any more.

#### Variable Naming [from javascript.info](https://javascript.info/variables#variable-naming)

There are three limitations on variable names in JavaScript:

1. Name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols `$` and `_`
2. First character must not be a digit.
3. There is a [list of reserved words](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#Keywords) which cannot be used as variable names because they are used by the language itself (ex: `let`, `class`, `return`, `function`, etc)

When the name contains multiple words, camelCase is commonly used.

In JavaScript, `apple` and `APPLE` are two different variables.

### Numbers

JavaScript follows the standard mathematical Order of Operations

1. **Parentheses** (or Brackets) are evaluated first.
2. **Multiplication** and **Division** are done next, from left to right.
3. **Addition** and **Subtraction** are done last, from left to right.

 Knowledge Check

- [What three keywords can you use to declare new variables?](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-variables-and-operators#variables)

> `let`, `const`, `var`

- [Which of the three variable declarations should you avoid and why?](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-variables-and-operators#variables)

> `var` because it is mostly deprecated. It is similar to `let` in that it allowed variables to be re-assigned but has quirks that were cleaned up when `let` and `const` were introduced.

- [What rules should you follow when naming variables?](https://javascript.info/variables#variable-naming)

> Names must contain only letters, digits, and symbols including `$` or `_`. Variables cannot match names of JavaScript elements. Non-Latin letters are allowed but not recommended.

- [What happens when you add numbers and strings together?](https://javascript.info/operators#string-concatenation-with-binary)

> When any of operands is a string, the other is converted to a string and the addition equation results in a concatenation

- [How does the Modulo (%), or Remainder, operator work?](https://javascript.info/operators#remainder)

> It will result in what remains of the integer division of the first integer by the second integer.

- [What’s the difference between `==` and `===`?](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_operators.asp)

> `==` is the comparison operator. it checks for equality and will return true if both values are equivalent after coercing their types to the same type. `===` means equal in value and type. (ex. `0 == false`, `"5" == 5`). `===` is the identity operator. it checks for strict equality and will only return true if the value and type of the operands are identical.

- [When would you receive a `NaN` result?](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_numbers.asp)

> By doing arithmetic with a non-numeric string (ex. `let x = 100 / "10"`)

- [How do you increment and decrement a number?](https://javascript.info/operators#increment-decrement)

> `++` will increase a variable by 1. `--` will decrease a variable by 1.

ex.

```js
let counter = 2;
counter++; // a shorter version of counter = counter + 1
alert ( counter ); //3
```

```js
let counter = 2;
counter--; // a shorter version of counter = counter - 1
alert ( counter ); //1
```

- [What’s the difference between prefixing and postfixing increment/decrement operators?](https://javascript.info/operators#increment-decrement)

> Prefix form (`++counter`) changes the value first and then returns the new value. Postfix form (`counter++`) returns the current value first then changes the value. We'd use prefix when we need the updated value first, and the postfix when the need the original value first.

- [What is operator precedence and how is it handled in JS?](https://javascript.info/operators#operator-precedence)

> Essentially PEMDAS, the order of operations in expressions. There is a precedence table that lists the order of precedence for all operators.

- [How do you access developer tools and the console?](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-variables-and-operators#how-to-run-javascript-code)

> Right click anywhere on a webpage and click on "Inspect" and there will be "Console" tab.

- [How do you log information to the console?](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-variables-and-operators#how-to-run-javascript-code)

> `console.log("information")`

- [What does unary plus operator do to string representations of integers? eg. +”10”](https://javascript.info/operators#numeric-conversion-unary)

> It converts the string into an integer. `+"10"` would convert the string `"10"` to the integer `10`
